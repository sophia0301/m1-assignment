                    <article>The Tuning Squad was started by me, Sophia Tapia and my two brothers
                        Alejandro Garcia, and Noah Tapia. The inspiration came from when my brother
                        got into the car scene. After he started going to meets and being around cars
                        more. It sparked my interest and got me into the car scene. Later on down the 
                        road, the Tuning Squad was born. While any normal auto body shop can help in 
                        starting off your modification journey, the Tuning Squad brings its own unigue 
                        take on modifying. The Tuning Squad schedules appointments and does at home jobs
                        bringing all the tools and essentials to the customers house and complete everything right
                        there at their home.
